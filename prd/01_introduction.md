Of course. Here is the revised introduction for the Impala PRD, formatted for the chat window.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Purpose

The core mission of Impala is to redefine the experience of data analysis. Deriving insights from data is often a slow, complex, and frustrating process, blocked by clunky tools and the need for specialized technical skills. Impala replaces this complexity with a blazingly fast, intuitive, and intelligent platform designed to move at the speed of thought.

At its heart, Impala leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an intelligent co-pilot. The app uses AI not to perform the analysis itself—which can lead to errors and hallucinations—but to assist the user in a transparent and reliable way. LLMs will help understand messy data, automate cleaning and structuring, generate testable hypotheses, and translate natural language questions into robust, executable code (SQL or Python). This ensures that the final analysis is both AI-accelerated and mathematically sound.

This document outlines the requirements for building a product that allows users to effortlessly upload raw data, perform guided analysis, generate compelling visualizations, and create trustworthy, data-backed narratives in a single, unified workspace.

## 1.2. Target Audience

Impala is designed primarily for business professionals who need to make data-driven decisions but lack a deep technical background in data science or engineering. Our target users are domain experts, not necessarily data experts.

- **Primary Audience: The Business User.** This includes roles like Marketing Managers, Operations Leads, and Financial Analysts. Their primary goal is to answer business questions using the data they work with daily (e.g., sales reports, budget spreadsheets, campaign results). They are often blocked by their reliance on technical teams or their unfamiliarity with complex BI tools.
- **Secondary Audience: The Data-Savvy Analyst.** This includes users who are comfortable with data but are looking for a faster, more agile way to prototype analyses and communicate findings. They value efficiency and the ability to quickly move from raw data to a shareable insight.

## 1.3. Goals and Objectives

The success of Impala will be measured against the following high-level goals:

- **Immediate Value Through Design:** Deliver a beautiful, intuitive, and delightful user experience that stands in stark contrast to traditional BI tools. The interface must be clean, responsive, and guide the user, delivering tangible value from the very first interaction.
- **Radical Efficiency & Automation:** Drastically reduce the time users spend waiting or performing mundane, repetitive tasks. Impala will use smart automation to handle data cleaning, structuring, and preparation, minimizing idle time and allowing users to focus on exploration and insight, not data janitorial work.
- **Intelligent & Transparent AI Partnership:** Leverage LLMs as a smart assistant, not a black box. The goal is to use AI to understand data context, generate hypotheses, and write transparent, verifiable code for analysis, charts, and tables. This provides the speed of AI without sacrificing the trust and accuracy of traditional computation.
- **Empowerment:** Enable non-technical users to conduct end-to-end data analysis independently. This means providing the tools to upload, clean, analyze, visualize, and share insights without writing code or requesting support from a data team.
- **Trust:** Build a platform where every number and visualization is transparent and traceable back to its source. Users should feel confident in the insights they generate and share.
